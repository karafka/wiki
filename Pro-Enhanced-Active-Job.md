While Kafka is not a message queue, it has certain features that make it a great fit for Active Job, especially when strict ordering and scaling are desired.

Enhanced Active Job adapter provides extra capabilities to regular Active Job to elevate the combination of Active Job and Kafka.

## Enabling Enhanced Active Job

No action needs to be taken. Please follow the [Active Job setup](Active-Job#active-job-setup) instructions, and the moment you enable Karafka Pro, it will use the Enhanced Active Job components.

## Ordered Jobs

With the Karafka Enhanced Active Job adapter, you can ensure jobs processing order. This means that with proper `partitioner` usage, you can ensure that for a given resource, only one job runs at a time and that jobs will run in the order in which they were enqueued.

You can tell Karafka to which partition send a given job based on the job arguments. For it to work, Karafka provides two `karafka_options` options you can set:

- `partitioner` - a callable that accepts the job as the argument
- `partition_key_type` - either `:key` (default) or `:partition_key`

Jobs sent to the same partition will always be processed in the order. This can be useful when you process data of objects for which you need to apply your logic sequentially without risking any concurrency problems. For example for applying updates in a consistent order.

```ruby
# An example job that updates user attributes in the background job
class Job < ActiveJob::Base
  queue_as TOPIC

  karafka_options(
    # Make sure that all jobs related to a given user are always dispatched to the same partition
    partitioner: ->(job) { job.arguments.first },
    partition_key_type: :key
  )

  def perform(user_id, attributes)
    User.find(user_id).update!(attributes)
  end
end
```

The above code will ensure that jobs related to the same user will always be dispatched to the same consumer.

We recommend using the `:key` as then it can be used for combining Enhanced Active Job with [Virtual Partitions](Pro-Virtual-Partitions).

## Execution warranties

Same execution warranties apply as for standard [Active Job adapter](Active-Job#execution-warranties).

## Behaviour on errors

Same error behaviors apply as for standard [Active Job adapter](Active-Job#behaviour-on-errors).

**Note**: Please keep in mind that if you use it in combination with [Virtual Partitions](Pro-Virtual-Partitions), marking jobs as consumed (done) will happen only **after** all virtually partitioned consumers finished their work collectively. There is **no** intermediate marking in between jobs in that scenario.

## Behaviour on revocation

Enhanced Active Job adapter has revocation awareness. That means that Karafka will stop processing other pre-buffered jobs upon discovering that a given partition has been revoked. In a scenario of a longer job where the revocation happened during the job execution, only at most one job per partition will be processed twice. You can mitigate this scenario with static group memberships.

## Behaviour on shutdown

The same shutdown behavior applies as for standard [Active Job adapter](Active-Job#behaviour-on-shutdown).

## Usage with Virtual Partitions

For the Enhanced Active Job adapter to work with Virtual Partitions, you need to update your `karafka.rb` and use the `virtual_partitions` settings in the Active Job topic section:

```ruby
class KarafkaApp < Karafka::App
  setup do |config|
    # ...
  end

  routes.draw do
    active_job_topic :default do
      virtual_partitions(
        partitioner: ->(job) { job.key }
      )
    end
  end
end
```

Your partitioner will accept the wrapping message of a job. Since the payload is the serialized job, you will **not** have access to the payload. We recommend using either key or headers metadata for virtual partitioning.

Please keep in mind that with Virtual Partitions, the offset will be committed after all the Virtual Partitions work is done. There is **no** "per job" marking as processed.

## Usage with Long-Running Jobs

For the Enhanced Active Job adapter to work with Long-Running Jobs, you need to update your `karafka.rb` and use the `long_running_job` setting in the Active Job topic section:

```ruby
class KarafkaApp < Karafka::App
  setup do |config|
    # ...
  end

  routes.draw do
    active_job_topic :default do
      long_running_job true
    end
  end
end
```
