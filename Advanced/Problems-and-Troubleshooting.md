# Help!

Read below for tips.  If you still need help, you can:

* Ask your question in [The Karafka official Slack channel](https://slack.karafka.io)
* [Open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/issues/new).  (Don't be afraid to open an issue, even if it's not a Karafka bug.  An issue is just a conversation, not an accusation!)
* Check our [FAQ](/docs/FAQ) and the [Pro FAQ](/docs/Pro-FAQ)

You **should not** email any Karafka committer privately.

Please respect our time and efforts by sticking to one of the options above.

Please consider buying the Pro subscription for additional priority Pro support and extra features.

## Reporting problems

When you encounter issues with Karafka, there are several things you can do:

- Feel free to open a [Github issue](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/issues)
- Feel free to ask on our [Slack channel](https://slack.karafka.io)
- Use our [integration specs](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/tree/master/spec/integrations) and [example apps](https://github.com/karafka/example-apps) to create a reproduction code that you can then share with us.

## Debugging

Karafka now has a dedicated and comprehensive debugging guide that covers troubleshooting message duplication, offset handling, crashes, and other consumer-related issues. To keep things focused, debugging content has been moved out of this document and can be found in the new [Debugging](https://karafka.io/docs/Debugging/) document.
