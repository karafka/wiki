# Upgrading to WaterDrop 2.8

## `throw(:abort)` No Longer Allowed To Abort Transactions

Replace:

```ruby
producer.transaction do
  messages.each do |message|
    # Pipe all events
    producer.produce_async(topic: 'events', payload: message.raw_payload)
  end

  # And abort if no more events are needed
  throw(:abort) if KnowledgeBase.more_events_needed?
end
```

With:

```ruby
producer.transaction do
  messages.each do |message|
    # Pipe all events
    producer.produce_async(topic: 'events', payload: message.raw_payload)
  end

  # And abort if more events are no longer needed
  raise(WaterDrop::AbortTransaction) if KnowledgeBase.more_events_needed?
end
```

## `return`, `break` and `throw` Are No Longer Allowed Inside Transaction Block

Previously, transactions would abort if you exited early using `return`, `break`, or `throw`. This could create unexpected behavior, where users might not notice the rollback or have different intentions. For example, the following would trigger a rollback:

```ruby
MAX = 10

def process(messages)
  count = 0

  producer.transaction do
    messages.each do |message|
      count += 1

      producer.produce_async(topic: 'events', payload: message.raw_payload)

      # This would trigger a rollback.
      return if count >= MAX
    end
  end
end
```

This is a source of errors, hence such exits are no longer allowed. You can implement similar flow control inside of your methods that are wrapped in a WaterDrop transaction:

```ruby
MAX = 10

def process(messages)
  producer.transaction do
    # Early return from this method will not affect the transaction.
    # It will be committed
    insert_with_limit(messages)
  end
end

def insert_with_limit(messages)
  count = 0

  messages.each do |message|
    count += 1

    producer.produce_async(topic: 'events', payload: message.raw_payload)

    # This would trigger a rollback.
    return if count >= MAX
  end
end
```
