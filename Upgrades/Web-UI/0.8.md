# Upgrading to Web UI 0.8

This is a **major** release that brings many things to the table.

## Configuration

**No** configuration changes are needed.

## Deployment

Because of the reporting schema update, it is recommended to:

0. Make sure you have upgraded to `0.7.10` before and that it was fully deployed.
1. Test the upgrade on a staging or dev environment.
2. Starting from `0.7.0` Karafka Web UI supports rolling deploys, so there is no need to "stop the world".
3. The Web UI interface may throw 500 errors during the upgrade because of schema incompatibility (until Puma is deployed). This will have no long-term effects and can be ignored.
4. `Karafka::Web::Errors::Processing::IncompatibleSchemaError` **is expected**. It is part of the Karafka Web UI zero-downtime deployment strategy. This error allows the Web UI materialization consumer to back off and wait for it to be replaced with a new one.
5. Perform a rolling deployment (or a regular one) and replace all consumer processes.
6. Update the Web UI Puma.
7. **No** CLI command execution is required. Starting from this release (`0.8.0`), the Karafka Web UI contains an automatic schema migrator that allows it to automatically adjust internal topic data formats.
8. Enjoy.
