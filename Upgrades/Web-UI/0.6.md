# Upgrading to Web UI 0.6

Because of the reporting schema update, it is recommended to:

- First, deploy **all** the Karafka consumer processes (`karafka server`)
- Deploy the Web update to your web server.

Please note that if you decide to use the updated Web UI with not updated consumers, you may hit a 500 error or offset related data may not be displayed correctly.

## Disabling producers instrumentation

Producers error tracking **is** enabled by default. If you want to opt out of it, you need to disable the producers' instrumentation by clearing the producers' listeners:

```ruby
Karafka::Web.setup do |config|
  # Do not instrument producers with web-ui listeners
  config.tracking.producers.listeners = []
end
```

## Custom producers instrumentation

By default, Karafka Web-UI instruments only `Karafka.producer`. If you use producers initialized by yourself, you need to connect the listeners to them manually. To do so, run the following code:

```ruby
::Karafka::Web.config.tracking.producers.listeners.each do |listener|
  MY_CUSTOM_PRODUCER.monitor.subscribe(listener)
end
```

Please make sure **not** to do it for the default `Karafka.producer` because it is instrumented out of the box.
