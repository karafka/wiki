# Upgrading to Web UI 0.3

Because of the removal of compatibility fallbacks for some metrics fetches, it is recommended to:

- First, deploy **all** the Karafka consumer processes (`karafka server`)
- Deploy the Web update to your web server.

Please note that if you decide to use the updated Web UI with not updated consumers, you may hit a 500 error.
