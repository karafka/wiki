# Web UI Features

Karafka Web UI contains several features allowing you to understand your system's karafka consumption process.

Below you can find a comprehensive description of the most important features you can use.

!!! note ""

    Karafka Pro offers enhanced Web UI with many additional metrics and functionalities.

## Dashboard

!!! note ""

    More graphs are available only in our Pro offering.

The dashboard provides an all-encompassing insight into your Karafka operations. Itâ€™s an indispensable tool for anyone looking to monitor, optimize, and troubleshoot their Karafka processes. With its user-friendly interface and detailed metrics, you have everything you need to ensure the smooth running of your Kafka operations.

## Consumers

!!! note ""

    More metrics and detailed consumers inspection are available only in our Pro offering.

The consumers status view allows users to view and monitor the performance of Kafka-running consumers. The page displays real-time data and aggregated metrics about the status of the consumers, such as their current offset, lag, the current state of consumers, and others.

</p>

The following metrics are available for each consumer:

- `Started` - The moment when the given consumer process was started.
- `Memory` - RSS (Resident Set Size) measures memory usage in an operating system. It represents the portion of a process's memory held in RAM and is "resident" in the system.
- `Utilization` - Displays the number of threads in a given process against a number of threads actively processing data in a given moment.
- `Total lag` - Sumed lag from all the partitions actively consumed by a given process.

## Jobs

!!! note ""

    More metrics are available in our Pro offering.

This page provides a real-time view of the jobs that are currently being processed, including information such as:

- `Process` - Process name where the job is running.
- `Topic` - Topic and partition which the job is processing.
- `Consumer` - Class of the consumer that is running.
- `Type` - Type of work: `#consume`, `#revoke` or `#shutdown`
- `Started at` - Since when the job is running.

## Health

!!! note ""

    This functionality is available only in our Pro offering.

This dashboard view shows Karafka consumers' groups' health state with their lag aggregated information and basic trends.

[Here](https://karafka.io/docs/Pro-Enhanced-Web-UI-Health) you can learn more about the information available in this dashboard view.

</p>

## Routing

The Routing UI view allows users to inspect Karafka's routing configuration, including details about particular topics. It recognizes the routing patterns, though it is worth remembering that it can take Karafka Web UI up to 5 minutes to identify and map newly detected topics due to the internal caching layer.

</p>

## Explorer

!!! note ""

    This functionality is available only in our Pro offering.

Karafka Data Explorer is an essential tool for users seeking to navigate and comprehend the data produced to Kafka. Offering an intuitive interface and a deep understanding of the routing table, the explorer ensures that users can access deserialized data effortlessly for seamless viewing. You can read more about it [here](https://karafka.io/docs/Pro-Enhanced-Web-UI/#explorer).

## Errors

!!! note ""

    More backtrace and high-scale features are available in our Pro offering.

A Karafka errors page UI view allows users to inspect errors occurring during messages consumption and production, including all the asynchronous errors coming from `librdkafka`. It includes the following information:

- `Origin` - Topic and partition from which the error comes or code location for non-consumption related errors.
- `Process name` - Name of the process on which the error occurred.
- `Error` - Error type.
- `Occurred at` - Moment in time when the error occurred.
- `Backtrace` (Pro only) - Full backtrace that shows the sequence of methods and calls that lead up to an exception (an error).

## DLQ / Dead

!!! note ""

    This functionality is available only in our Pro offering.

The Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) dashboard allows users to view messages that have failed to be processed and were skipped and moved to the Dead Letter Queue topic with their original details.

## Status

The Karafka Web UI status page allows you to check and troubleshoot the state of your Karafka Web UI integration with your application.

It can help you identify and mitigate problems that would cause the Web UI to malfunction or misbehave. If you see the `404` page or have issues with Karafka Web UI, this page is worth visiting.

It is accessible regardless of connection permissions to Kafka and can be found under the `/status` path of your Karafka Web installation.

Each check may display one of the following statuses:

<table border="1">
    <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Check Status</th>
          <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>Success</td>
          <td>All is good, and the given check has passed.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Failure</td>
          <td>Check has failed. Additional information should be provided to explain the nature of the issue.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Halted</td>
          <td>Check was not executed due to a previous check failing. This status does not necessarily mean that a specific process was halted but rather that the check could not be performed because a prior check failed.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Info</td>
          <td>Informative message that does not perform any checks but provides relevant details.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
