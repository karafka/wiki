!!! info "Simplification Notice"

    The calculation above is a simplification, and there may be other factors impacting the cost. This estimate does not include the cost of maintaining a Kafka cluster but rather the additional cost of running the Web UI within an existing cluster.

## Simplified Formula

For a quick estimation, a single Karafka consumer will cost between **$0.07** and **$0.40** per month. This range accounts for the variability in factors such as message frequency, state materialization, data size, and the efficiency of your Kafka configuration.

This simplified formula provides a ballpark figure to help you plan and budget the operational costs of running Karafka with its Web UI. Remember that actual costs can vary based on your specific setup and usage patterns.
