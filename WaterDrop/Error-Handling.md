Understanding WaterDrop error handling mechanisms is crucial for developing robust and reliable Kafka-based applications.

!!! note

    This document focuses on error handling for the Standard Producer (non-transactional). For information regarding the error behavior of the Transactional Producer, it is highly recommended to refer to the [Transactional Producer](WaterDrop-Transactions) documentation.

WaterDrop operates with a fully asynchronous architecture, maintaining a memory buffer for efficiently handling messages. This buffer stores messages waiting to be dispatched or already in the delivery process. Following the delivery of a message or the occurrence of an error after reaching the maximum retry limit, WaterDrop enqueues a delivery event into an internal event queue. This event includes the relevant delivery outcome, ensuring that each message's status is accurately tracked and managed within the system.

## Operational Modes

WaterDrop provides three distinct APIs, each with unique error-handling behaviors that are essential to understand for practical usage:

1. **Single Message Dispatch (`#produce_sync` and `#produce_async`)**: These methods send a single message to Kafka. Errors in this mode are specifically related to the individual message being sent. If an error occurs, it's directly tied to the single message dispatch attempt, making it straightforward to identify and handle issues related to message production or delivery.

1. **Batch Dispatch (`#produce_many_sync` and `#produce_many_async`)**: These methods allow sending multiple messages to Kafka in a batch. In this mode, errors can be more complex, as they might pertain to any single message within the batch. It's vital to have a strategy to identify which message(s) caused the error and respond accordingly. Error handling in this context needs to consider partial failures where some messages are dispatched successfully while others are not.

1. **Transactional Dispatch**: This mode supports operations within a Kafka transaction. It suits scenarios where you must maintain exactly-once delivery semantics or atomicity across multiple messages and partitions. Errors in this mode can be transaction-wide, affecting all messages sent within the transaction's scope. The transactional producer operates under its own set of rules and complexities, and it's crucial to refer to the [specific documentation](WaterDrop-Transactions) page dedicated to transactional dispatch for guidance on handling errors effectively.

## Error Types

In WaterDrop, errors encountered during the message-handling process can be categorized into five distinct types. Each type represents a specific stage or aspect of the message delivery lifecycle, highlighting the diverse issues in a message queuing system.

- **Pre-Handle Inline Errors**: These errors occur at the initial stage of message production, preventing the creation of a delivery handle. Inline errors indicate the message has not been sent to the message queue. A typical example of this type of error is the `:queue_full`, which occurs when the message cannot be queued due to a lack of available buffer space. This type of error is immediate and directly related to the message production process and indicates a dispatch failure.

- **Wait Timeout Errors**: This error arises when there is an exception during the invocation of the `#wait` method on a delivery handle. This can happen either when calling `#wait` directly after `#produce_async`, or when producing messages synchronously, especially if the maximum wait time is reached. Notably, a wait error does not necessarily mean that the message will not be delivered; it primarily indicates that the allotted wait time for the message to be processed was exceeded. Please know that `#wait` can raise additional errors, indicating final delivery failure. With the default configuration where `max_wait_timeout` exceeds other message delivery timeouts, the `#wait` raised error should always be final.

- **Intermediate Errors**: These errors can occur anytime, are not necessarily linked to producing specific messages, do not happen inline, and are published via the `error.occurred` notifications channel. They usually signify operational problems within the system and are often temporary. Intermediate errors might indicate issues such as network interruptions or temporary system malfunctions. They are not directly tied to the fate of individual messages but rather to the overall health and functioning of the messaging system.

- **Delivery Failures**: This type of error is specifically related to the non-delivery of a message. A delivery failure occurs when a message, identifiable by its label, is retried several times but ultimately fails to be delivered. After a certain period, WaterDrop determines that it is no longer feasible to continue attempting delivery. This error signifies a definitive failure in the message delivery process, marking the end of the message's lifecycle with a non-delivery status.

- **ProduceMany Errors**: During non-transactional batch dispatches, some messages may be successfully enqueued, and some may not. In such a case, this error will be raised. It will contain a `#dispatched` method with appropriate delivery handles for successfully enqueued messages. Those messages have the potential to be delivered based on their delivery report, but messages without matching delivery handles were for sure rejected and not enqueued for delivery.

- **Transactional ProduceMany Errors**: In a transactional batch dispatch, all messages within the transaction are either successfully enqueued and delivered together or not at all. If a failure occurs during the transaction, no messages are dispatched, and a rollback is performed. Therefore, the `#dispatched` method will always be empty in this error, as either all messages have been delivered successfully or none have been delivered. The transactional nature ensures atomicity, meaning that partial success or failure is not possible, and no message delivery handles will be available for any messages in case of a rollback.

- **Fatal Errors**: These are critical errors that prevent the producer from continuing to operate correctly. Fatal errors can occur in both idempotent and transactional producers. When a fatal error occurs, the producer may need to be reloaded to recover. WaterDrop provides automatic recovery mechanisms to handle these errors gracefully. See the [Fatal Error Recovery](#fatal-error-recovery) section for more details.

Each error type plays a crucial role in understanding and managing the complexities of message handling in WaterDrop, providing precise categorization for troubleshooting and system optimization.

## Tracking Deliveries and Errors

Due to WaterDrop's asynchronous nature, we recommend either using a transactional producer with its inline collective error handling and delivery warranties or using the async API and using the `error.occurred` notifications to detect and recognize messages that were not successfully delivered with inline error tracking for issues that would arise before the message had a chance to be enqueued for delivery.

Every event published to `error.occurred` contains a type, and if the type is not `librdkafka.dispatch_error`, the error is intermediate or partial. It is worth logging but does not indicate that the dispatched message was not delivered. Events with the type set to `librdkafka.dispatch_error` will always contain a full delivery report for each enqueued message with exact details on why a message was not delivered.

In general, we recommend following a similar flow to the one below:

### Single Message Dispatch

All the potential errors that will relate to a single dispatched message:

```ruby
begin
  # sync or async
  producer.produce_async(...)
rescue => e
  case e
  when WaterDrop::Errors::MessageInvalidError
    puts "Message is invalid and was not sent"
    raise e
  when WaterDrop::Errors::ProduceError
    puts "Final error instrumented as error.occurred so we don't need to re-raise it"
    puts "WaterDrop has already retried `Rdkafka::RdkafkaError`s due to :queue_full if wait_on_queue_full was enabled, and the wait time did not exceed wait_timeout_on_queue_full. This means we did not get the delivery handle and this dispatch will for sure not reach Kafka"
    puts "If the underlying cause was a Rdkafka::Producer::DeliveryHandle::WaitTimeoutError (for #produce_sync only), the message could still reach Kafka"
  else
    # Any other errors. This should not happen and indicates trouble.
    puts "Something else have happened. Read the error for details"
    puts "This dispatch will not reach Kafka"
    raise e
  end
end
```

```ruby
producer.monitor.subscribe('error.occurred') do |event|
  case event[:type]
  # Every single message that received a handler is either delivered or fails 
  when 'librdkafka.dispatch_error'
    puts "Message with label: #{event[:delivery_report].label} failed to be delivered"
    ErrorsTracker.track(event[:error])
  when
    # Track all the others
    ErrorsTracker.track(event[:error])
  end
end
```

### Batch Messages Dispatch

Errors may refer to one of the messages from the batch, and part of the messages might have been dispatched:

```ruby
begin
  # sync or async
  producer.produce_many_async(...)
rescue => e
  case e
  when WaterDrop::Errors::ProduceManyError
    puts "Something went wrong and we need to check messages"
    successful_handles = e.dispatched
    puts "Messages with following labels have handles: #{successful_handles.map(&:label)}"
    puts "Those without handles were for sure not delivered"
    puts "The original cause was: #{e.cause}"
  else
    # Any other errors. This should not happen and indicates trouble.
    raise e
  end
end
```

```ruby
producer.monitor.subscribe('error.occurred') do |event|
  case event[:type]
  # Every single message that received a handle is delivered or fails event 
  when 'librdkafka.dispatch_error'
    puts "Message with label: #{event[:delivery_report].label} failed to be delivered"
    ErrorsTracker.track(event[:error])
  when
    # Track all the others
    ErrorsTracker.track(event[:error])
  end
end
```

## Fatal Error Recovery

WaterDrop provides automatic recovery mechanisms for fatal errors that occur in both idempotent and transactional producers. Fatal errors are critical issues that prevent the producer from continuing to operate correctly, such as broker state inconsistencies or internal producer failures.

!!! warning "Message Loss Risk During Reload"

    Fatal error recovery involves reloading the entire producer client, which causes a brief interruption in message production. Any messages in the internal buffer that were not yet delivered may be lost unless they are part of a transaction. However, the producer will always emit notification events for messages that are dropped during reload, and the Labeling API can be used to track and identify which messages were not delivered. Ensure your application can tolerate this behavior before enabling this feature.

### Idempotent Producer Fatal Error Recovery

!!! info "Related: Idempotence Overview"

    For a comprehensive overview of idempotence concepts, configuration, and best practices, see the [Idempotence and Acknowledgements](WaterDrop-Idempotence-and-Acknowledgements) documentation.

For idempotent producers (non-transactional), WaterDrop can automatically reload the producer when fatal errors occur. This feature is **disabled by default** and must be explicitly enabled through configuration.

#### Why Idempotent Producers May Enter Fatal States

Idempotent producers may enter a fatal state when they encounter unrecoverable errors that would violate their core guarantees of message ordering and preventing duplicates. Understanding these scenarios helps in configuring appropriate recovery mechanisms:

**Sequence Desynchronization**

When the producer's internal sequence tracking becomes desynchronized with the broker's expectations, the producer cannot safely continue operations without risking message loss or duplication. This typically occurs due to:

- Kafka cluster disruptions such as major broker failures and restarts
- Partition leader reassignments during maintenance or failover
- Network partitions that cause message retries with inconsistent state

**Producer Metadata Loss**

When the broker cannot locate the producer's metadata (Producer ID and epoch information), it cannot validate whether messages are duplicates or maintain ordering guarantees. This becomes fatal when:

- There are in-flight messages or pending retries that cannot be safely recovered
- Broker loses producer state (for example, UNKNOWN_PRODUCER_ID) due to log truncation, leader changes, or prolonged inactivity, which removes state needed to validate sequence numbers for idempotency

**Message Sequence and Ordering Issues**

During retries, the producer must preserve per-record ordering and sequence numbers to maintain idempotency; fatal errors can occur when the broker detects out-of-order sequences, an unknown producer ID, or a fenced epoch.

**Impact on Applications**

When a fatal error occurs:

- In WaterDrop, subsequent produce API calls will fail with a fatal error until the producer is closed or reloaded.
- If auto-reload is enabled, WaterDrop will reload the producer; otherwise, the application should close and recreate it.
- In-flight messages that cannot be delivered will be dropped and reported as failures.

#### Configuration

```ruby
producer = WaterDrop::Producer.new do |config|
  config.kafka = {
    'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092',
    'enable.idempotence': true
  }

  # Enable automatic reload on idempotent fatal errors
  config.reload_on_idempotent_fatal_error = true
  # Wait 5 seconds (5000ms) before retrying after a fatal error
  config.wait_backoff_on_idempotent_fatal_error = 5_000
  # Maximum 5 reload attempts before giving up
  config.max_attempts_on_idempotent_fatal_error = 5
end
```

**Configuration Options:**

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `reload_on_idempotent_fatal_error` | `false` | Enable automatic producer reload on fatal errors for idempotent producers |
| `wait_backoff_on_idempotent_fatal_error` | `5000` | Time in milliseconds to wait before retrying after a fatal error |
| `max_attempts_on_idempotent_fatal_error` | `5` | Maximum number of reload attempts before giving up |

### Transactional Producer Fatal Error Recovery

For transactional producers, fatal error recovery is **enabled by default** with more aggressive retry settings, as transactions require higher reliability guarantees.

```ruby
producer = WaterDrop::Producer.new do |config|
  config.kafka = {
    'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092',
    'transactional.id': 'my-transactional-producer'
  }

  # Customize transactional fatal error recovery (optional)
  config.reload_on_transaction_fatal_error = true
  # Wait 1 second (1000ms) before continuing after a fatal error reload
  config.wait_backoff_on_transaction_fatal_error = 1_000
  # Maximum 10 reload attempts before giving up
  config.max_attempts_on_transaction_fatal_error = 10
end
```

**Configuration Options:**

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `reload_on_transaction_fatal_error` | `true` | Enable automatic producer reload on fatal errors for transactional producers |
| `wait_backoff_on_transaction_fatal_error` | `1000` | Time in milliseconds to wait before continuing after a fatal error reload |
| `max_attempts_on_transaction_fatal_error` | `10` | Maximum number of reload attempts before giving up |

### How Fatal Error Recovery Works

When a fatal error occurs:

1. **Error Detection**: WaterDrop detects that the error is fatal and cannot be resolved through normal retry mechanisms.

1. **Reload Decision**: If the reload feature is enabled and the maximum number of attempts has not been exceeded, WaterDrop initiates a producer reload.

1. **Producer Reload**: The underlying librdkafka producer client is completely reloaded, clearing any internal state that may have caused the fatal error.

1. **Backoff Period**: WaterDrop waits for the configured backoff period before retrying the operation.

1. **Retry**: The operation is retried with the newly reloaded producer.

1. **Attempt Tracking**: WaterDrop tracks the number of reload attempts to prevent infinite loops. If the maximum attempts are exceeded, the error is raised to the application.

### Monitoring Fatal Error Recovery

Fatal error recovery events are instrumented and can be monitored through WaterDrop's instrumentation system:

```ruby
# Monitor producer reload events (for both idempotent and transactional)
producer.monitor.subscribe('producer.reloaded') do |event|
  puts "Producer #{event[:producer_id]} reloaded on attempt #{event[:attempt]}"
end

# Monitor idempotent fatal errors
producer.monitor.subscribe('error.occurred') do |event|
  if event[:type] == 'librdkafka.idempotent_fatal_error'
    puts "Idempotent fatal error occurred on attempt #{event[:attempt]}"
    puts "Error: #{event[:error]}"
  end
end
```

## Summary

WaterDrop's error handling is designed to manage the complexities of message delivery in Kafka through three primary APIs, each with distinct behaviors. Understanding these modes is crucial because error-handling strategies depend heavily on the dispatch method used, and each requires a different approach to ensure messages are reliably delivered or properly retried. Additionally, WaterDrop provides detailed error information, helping developers understand the context and cause of failures to implement effective recovery strategies. Along with monitoring errors and tracking delivery reports, it's also recommended to use WaterDrop's Labeling capabilities. This feature allows you to tag messages with labels associated with their dispatches during the dispatch lifecycle, making tracking and managing messages throughout their journey easier.
