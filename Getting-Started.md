## Prerequisites

1. To verify that Apache Kafka is running, run the following command:

    ```shell
    docker ps | grep kafka
    ```

1. If it is not running, then set up Kafka. For instructions, see [Setting Up Kafka](Kafka-Setting-Up).

## For Existing Applications

1. Add Karafka to your Gemfile:

    ```shell
    # Make sure to install Karafka 2.5 as Karafka 1.4 is no longer maintained
    bundle add karafka --version ">= 2.5.0"
    ```

1. To install Karafka for both Rails and standalone applications, run the following command:

    ```shell
    bundle exec karafka install
    ```

    **Result**: All necessary files and directories are generated:

   - `karafka.rb` — the main file where you configure Karafka and define which consumers should consume what topics
   - `app/consumers/example_consumer.rb` — an example consumer
   - `app/consumers/application_consumer.rb` — the base consumer from which all consumers should inherit

1. To produce test messages, open the development console and enter:

    ```ruby
    # Works from any place in your code and is thread-safe
    # You usually want to produce async but here it may raise exception if Kafka is not available, etc
    Karafka.producer.produce_sync(topic: 'example', payload: { 'ping' => 'pong' }.to_json)
    ```

1. To start consuming messages, run the Karafka server:

    ```shell
    bundle exec karafka server

    # example outcome
    [7616dc24-505a-417f-b87b-6bf8fc2d98c5] Polled 2 messages in 1000ms
    [dcf3a8d8-0bd9-433a-8f63-b70a0cdb0732] Consume job for ExampleConsumer on example started
    {"ping"=>"pong"}
    {"ping"=>"pong"}
    [dcf3a8d8-0bd9-433a-8f63-b70a0cdb0732] Consume job for ExampleConsumer on example finished in 0ms
    ```

## For New Applications (Starting From Scratch)

1. Create a `Gemfile`:

    ```ruby
    # Gemfile
    source "https://rubygems.org"

    gem "karafka", ">= 2.5.0"
    ```

1. Run: `bundle install`

1. To install Karafka for both Rails and standalone applications, run the following command:

    ```shell
    bundle exec karafka install
    ```

    **Result**: All necessary files and directories are generated:

    - `karafka.rb` — the main file where you configure Karafka and where you define which consumers should consume what topics.
    - `app/consumers/example_consumer.rb` — an example consumer.
    - `app/consumers/application_consumer.rb` — the base consumer from which all consumers should inherit.

1. Run a development console to produce messages to this example topic:

    ```ruby
    # Works from any place in your code and is thread-safe
    # You usually want to produce async but here it may raise exception if Kafka is not available, etc
    Karafka.producer.produce_sync(topic: 'example', payload: { 'ping' => 'pong' }.to_json)
    ```

1. To start consuming messages, run the karafka server:

    ```shell
    bundle exec karafka server

    # example outcome
    [7616dc24-505a-417f-b87b-6bf8fc2d98c5] Polled 2 messages in 1000ms
    [dcf3a8d8-0bd9-433a-8f63-b70a0cdb0732] Consume job for ExampleConsumer on example started
    {"ping"=>"pong"}
    {"ping"=>"pong"}
    [dcf3a8d8-0bd9-433a-8f63-b70a0cdb0732] Consume job for ExampleConsumer on example finished in 0ms
    ```
    
1. (Optional) To install and configure the Web UI, see [Getting Started with the Web UI](Web-UI-Getting-Started).

## Example applications

If you have any problems setting up Karafka or need a ready application to play with, clone our examples repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/karafka/example-apps ./example_apps
```
