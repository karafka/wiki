!!! info "Auto-Generated Documentation"
    This catalog is automatically generated from the Karafka repository's integration test suite.

    It provides an overview of all integration tests and their purposes to help developers understand the framework's testing coverage and find relevant test examples.

!!! warning "Karafka Framework Integration Tests Only"
    This catalog exclusively covers **Karafka framework integration tests** and does not include tests from other components in the ecosystem such as:

    - **karafka-rdkafka** (Ruby bindings for librdkafka)
    - **WaterDrop** (Kafka producer library)
    - **Karafka Web UI** (monitoring and management interface)
    - **Other supporting libraries**

    Each component maintains its own separate test suite with different testing approaches and structures.
    This page serves as a **Karafka-specific reference** to help developers understand the framework's capabilities, use cases, and edge case handling through real integration scenarios.

    These integration tests are particularly valuable because they demonstrate **user-facing APIs and workflows** rather than internal implementation details, making them excellent examples for understanding how to work with Karafka in practice.
    For comprehensive testing documentation of other components, please refer to their respective repositories and documentation.

| `consumption/eofed/eof_offset_continuity_spec.rb` | Regression test to ensure correct offset handling when EOF is reached and subsequent messages are produced. Note: While librdkafka has a bug in rd_kafka_consume_batch() where offsets can be incorrectly advanced by 2 after EOF (see https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka/pull/5213), this bug does NOT affect Karafka as we use different APIs (rd_kafka_consumer_poll). However, the bug affects rd_kafka_position(), which we use. This test verifies that position tracking remains correct after EOF. Test scenario: 1. Produce 5 messages (offsets 0-4) 2. Consume all and reach EOF 3. Verify position is 5 (last consumed + 1) 4. Produce 1 more message (offset 5) 5. Verify all 6 messages are consumed with continuous offsets (0-5) |
| `consumption/eofed/error_recovery_spec.rb` | When eof is in use and `#eofed` crashes, it should emit an error but it should not cause any other crashes.

| `consumption/eofed/when_eof_reached_on_an_empty_topic_spec.rb` | When eof is in use and we get it on an empty topic, we should not use consume and start with `#eofed`. Shutdown should also work and respond to `#eofed?` |
| `consumption/eofed/when_eof_reached_on_multiple_empty_topics_spec.rb` | When eof is in use and we get it on an empty topic, we should not use consume and start with `#eofed` per each partition and topic independently |

| `consumption/strategies/default/of_many_partitions_with_many_workers_spec.rb` | Karafka should use more than one thread to consume independent topics partitions |
| `consumption/strategies/default/of_many_topics_on_many_workers_spec.rb` | Karafka should use more than one thread to consume independent topics |
| `consumption/strategies/default/of_many_topics_with_different_settings_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to consume multiple topics even when there are many subscription groups underneath due to non-homogeneous settings Usually configuration like this may not be optimal with too many subscription groups, nonetheless we should support it |

| `consumption/strategies/dlq/manual_dispatch_to_dlq_spec.rb` | When having the DLQ defined, we should be able to manually dispatch things to the DLQ and continue processing whenever we want. We can use this API to manually move stuff to DLQ without raising any errors upon detecting a corrupted message. |
| `consumption/strategies/dlq/multi_partition_source_target_flow_spec.rb` | When handling failing messages from a many partitions and there are many errors, standard DLQ will not provide strong ordering warranties inside DLQ. If you need strong ordered DLQ, please look into getting the Pro version. |
| `consumption/strategies/dlq/multi_partition_target_flow_spec.rb` | When handling failing messages from a single partition and there are many errors, standard DLQ will not provide strong ordering warranties inside DLQ. If you need strong ordered DLQ, please look into getting the Pro version. |
| `consumption/strategies/dlq/partial_manual_dlq_with_out_of_scope_crashes_spec.rb` | In case a manual DLQ dispatch is used on internal operations but the whole batch processing crashes, this can cause extensive reprocessing with small forward movement. Out of 100 messages produced, with this code we will end up with over a 1000 of failures because of how offsets are moving forward Note: This example illustrates a misuse of the DLQ flow and should not be used. |
| `consumption/strategies/dlq/with_custom_producer_spec.rb` | In the DLQ flow custom producer should be used when defined |
| `consumption/strategies/dlq/with_error_handling_pipeline_spec.rb` | We should be able to use DLQ in a pipeline where we handle each stage separately. |
| `consumption/strategies/dlq/with_first_crashing_spec.rb` | When its the first message ever that is constantly crashing it should move as expected with the DLQ flow |

| `consumption/strategies/dlq/without_intermediate_marking_spec.rb` | When we do not perform any markings as consumed we should nonetheless skip one after another starting from the beginning of the batch on failed batches. This should allow us to move one by one slowly and should mark on successful batches. |
| `consumption/strategies/dlq/without_marking_spec.rb` | When using DLQ without post error marking, the committed offset should remain unchanged |
| `consumption/strategies/dlq_mom/attempts_tracking_without_errors_spec.rb` | When running jobs without problems, there should always be only one attempt |

| `consumption/strategies/dlq_mom/without_intermediate_marking_spec.rb` | When we do not mark and user does not mark, we will end up with an infinite loop. This is expected and user should deal with this on his own. |
| `consumption/strategies/mom/manual_offset_with_error_every_bang_spec.rb` | When manual offset management is on, upon error Karafka should start again from the place it had in the checkpoint. If we checkpoint after each message is processed (here adding to array) it should not have any duplicates as the error happens before checkpointing |
| `consumption/strategies/mom/manual_offset_with_error_every_non_bang_spec.rb` | When manual offset management is on, upon error Karafka should start again from the place it had in the checkpoint. If we checkpoint after each message is processed (here adding to array) it should not have any duplicates as the error happens before checkpointing |
| `consumption/strategies/mom/manual_offset_with_error_interval_bang_spec.rb` | When manual offset management is on, upon error Karafka should start again from the place it had in the checkpoint, not from the beginning. We check here that this works well when we commit "from time to time", not every message |
| `consumption/strategies/mom/manual_offset_with_error_interval_non_bang_spec.rb` | When manual offset management is on, upon error Karafka should start again from the place it had in the checkpoint, not from the beginning. We check here that this works well when we commit "from time to time", not every message |

| `consumption/with_branching_logic_on_retry_spec.rb` | We should be able to apply custom logic flow, when re-processing data after an error. |
| `consumption/with_cluster_info_based_routes_spec.rb` | We should be able to define settings and then use cluster info to get topics and subscribe to them automatically also matching via regexp |
| `consumption/with_error_for_seek_offset_tracking_spec.rb` | Karafka should publish seek offset upon error so we know offset of message that failed @note This may be a bit more complex when doing batch processing operations |
| `consumption/with_existing_and_not_existing_topics_in_same_sg_spec.rb` | When Karafka starts consuming in one SG existing topic and not existing topic and auto create is off, it should emit an error but at the same time should consume from existing topic |
| `consumption/with_existing_cg_on_a_new_topic_spec.rb` | When we have an existing CG that gets a new topic from latest, it should pick from latest. We postpone second connection but because it has 'latest' start, it should not poll any data because data was published only in the past |
| `consumption/with_future_messages_due_to_drift_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to handle a case where the cluster and consumer times drifted Some metrics may not be 100% accurate and this should not happen often but may |
| `consumption/with_lazy_payload_deserialization_spec.rb` | Karafka when processing messages should deserialize only in case where we request payload to be deserialized even when iterating over all the objects. |
| `consumption/with_long_living_buffer_spec.rb` | Karafka should allow to create a long living buffer that we can use and fill as we go, beyond a single batch of data This will force several batches, so we won't end up with 1 huge as this is not what we want here |

| `consumption/with_mixed_performance_in_subscription_group_spec.rb` | When running work of a single consumer group from many subscription groups, upon shutdown we should not experience any rebalance problems as the shutdown should happen after all the work is done. |
| `consumption/with_mixed_subscription_groups_spec.rb` | When using separate subscription groups for every nth topic, we should have proper number of underlying clients. |
| `consumption/with_non_existing_topics_auto_create_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to poll on non-existing topics when auto-create is on and should not raise an error about it |
| `consumption/with_non_existing_topics_no_auto_create_spec.rb` | Karafka should raise an error when it encounters non-existing topic and no auto topic creation We need to allow errors so we can track them and check the propagation |
| `consumption/with_on_after_consume_method_spec.rb` | Karafka has a `#after_consume` method. This method should not be used as part of the official API but we add integration specs here just to make sure it runs as expected. |
| `consumption/with_on_before_consume_method_spec.rb` | Karafka has a `#before_consume` method. This method should not be used as part of the official API but we add integration specs here just to make sure it runs as expected. |
| `consumption/with_producer_disconnect_error_spec.rb` | When Karafka producer (WaterDrop) disconnects it should reconnect automatically. @note Here we force the disconnect by setting the `connections.max.idle.ms` to a really low value. With librdkafka updates, planned disconnections no longer emit "all brokers down" errors, so we test that the producer continues working after forced disconnection. |
| `consumption/with_reset_topic_spec.rb` | When weird things happen with partition (it disappears), Karafka receives weird metadata, etc we should be able to detect this and gracefully shutdown For any reason, especially affected is MSK during rolling updates. |

| `consumption/with_static_group_of_many_subscriptions_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to use few subscription groups with static group memberships This requires us to inject extra postfix to group id per client and should happen automatically. |
| `consumption/with_sync_mark_sa_consumed_after_revoke_spec.rb` | When we've lost a topic and end up with an `unknown_member_id`, we should handle that gracefully while running `mark_as_consumed\!`. |

| `consumption/without_persistence_enabled_spec.rb` | Karafka should not use same consumer instance when consumer_persistence is set to false Each batch of data should be consumed with new instance |
| `consumption/worker_critical_error_behaviour_spec.rb` | Karafka should recover from critical errors that happened in the workers while consuming jobs. It should notify on a proper channel and do other stuff @note This test is a bit special as due to how Karafka operates, when unexpected issue happens in particular moments, it can bubble up and exit 2 |
| `consumption/wrapping/consume_spec.rb` | Karafka should allow for wrapping on consume |
| `consumption/wrapping/on_error_spec.rb` | Errors in the processing should not affect wrapping itself |
| `consumption/wrapping/wrapped_error_handling_spec.rb` | Errors happening in wrap should be handled gracefully and by no means should they leak out If there is a chance of error (like pool timeout), it should be handled in the consumer flow so the consumer can back off if needed |

| `deserialization/routing_default_deserializer_usage_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to use routing default deserializers |
| `embedding/puma_single_poro/flow_spec.rb` | Karafka should run from a Puma server easily |
| `embedding/puma_with_worker_poro/flow_spec.rb` | Karafka should run from a Puma server easily |
| `embedding/quiet_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to run as embedded code and should respond to quiet. |
| `embedding/sidekiq_poro/flow_spec.rb` | Test that Karafka can run embedded in Sidekiq without Redis This test does not cover all the cases because it uses the Sidekiq testing mode, but at least it ensures that we don't have any immediate crashing conflicts. |
| `embedding/simple_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to run as embedded code. |
| `embedding/tag_injection_spec.rb` | When running Karafka using the embedding API, we should get appropriate tag attached automatically to the Karafka process |

| `instrumentation/app_status_lifecycle_flow_spec.rb` | Karafka when started and stopped should go through all the lifecycle stages States changes that are published |
| `instrumentation/assignment_and_revocation_logs_spec.rb` | Karafka should have the info level logging of assigned and revoked partitions |
| `instrumentation/assignments_tracker_revocation_detection_spec.rb` | This spec demonstrates using Fiber storage to pass context (topic, partition) to helper classes without explicit arguments, enabling them to check assignment status. |
| `instrumentation/before_schedule_jobs_tracking_spec.rb` | Karafka should instrument prior to each consumer being scheduled |
| `instrumentation/cg_info_on_maximum_poll_interval_exceeded_spec.rb` | When we exceed max.poll.interval the error should contain CG name |
| `instrumentation/client_events_poll_on_assignment_loss_spec.rb` | This spec verifies that the client.events_poll event is emitted when assignment loss is detected, and that the AssignmentsTracker properly clears assignments in response. |

| `instrumentation/initialized_flow_spec.rb` | Karafka should publish correct events post-initializing the consumer instances When initialization fails, it should also publish error |
| `instrumentation/listener_lifecycle_flow_spec.rb` | Karafka should publish listener lifecycle events |
| `instrumentation/low_level_buffer_analysis_spec.rb` | We should be able to inject a low level monitor for ensuring, that there are no duplicates in the data received from rdkafka |
| `instrumentation/nil_missing_data_edge_cases_spec.rb` | Instrumentation should handle events with nil/missing data gracefully without crashing the monitoring system or causing data corruption. |

| `instrumentation/post_errors_instrumentation_error_spec.rb` | If post-error instrumentation re-raises the error so it bubbles up to the worker, it will crash and karafka should stop. Since an endless bubbling error cannot be rescued, it will force Karafka to move into a forceful shutdown. |
| `instrumentation/post_mutation_messages_count_reporting_spec.rb` | When we mutate the messages batch size, it should not impact the instrumentation Alongside that, because we use auto-offset management, it also should not crash as it should use original messages references. |
| `instrumentation/process_tagging_spec.rb` | We should have abilities to tag process with whatever info we want |
| `instrumentation/producer_logger_on_forks_spec.rb` | After fork unused producer logger should work as expected Note: We check this because rdkafka had an issue where fork logger would not work at all. |

| `instrumentation/statistics_callback_with_crashing_subscription_spec.rb` | Karafka should not hang or crash when we receive the statistics processing error. It should recover and be responsive. |
| `instrumentation/statistics_frozen_lag_on_paused_spec.rb` | When partition is paused for a longer period of time, its metadata won't be refreshed. This means that consumer-reported statistics lag will be frozen. This spec illustrates that. |
| `instrumentation/statistics_on_lag_with_many_sub_group_spec.rb` | Karafka when consuming messages, should report per topic partition consumer lag By using two subscription groups, we can make sure we have separate connections and that we fetch data in parallel and ship it as it goes, so one topic partition data is not causing a wait on other things ref https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/wiki/FAQ#how-are-partitions-fetched |
| `instrumentation/statistics_on_lag_with_one_sub_group_spec.rb` | Karafka when consuming messages, should report per topic partition consumer lag Since librdkafka fetches data in batches onto the queue, this can cause the lagged partition to run first without processing anything else despite good concurrency settings This can be solved either via subscription group distribution or by tuning the per partition data that goes into the buffer ref https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/wiki/FAQ#how-are-partitions-fetched |
| `instrumentation/statistics_publishing_on_long_poll_spec.rb` | Karafka should publish statistics even when a long blocking processing occurs and there are no processing workers available as it should happen from one of the main threads. |

| `instrumentation/vendors/kubernetes/consuming_liveness_parallel_regular_flow_spec.rb` | When consuming using multiple subscription groups and all of them are within time limits, we should never get 500 |
| `instrumentation/vendors/kubernetes/consuming_liveness_parallel_timeout_flow_spec.rb` | When consuming using multiple subscription groups and only one hangs, k8s listener should be able to detect that. |
| `instrumentation/vendors/kubernetes/consuming_liveness_timeout_flow_spec.rb` | When consuming takes more time then expected, we should see that in the status |

| `instrumentation/with_watermarks_querying_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to query watermark offsets for multiple topics and partitions using a single consumer instance |
| `lags/consumption_delayed_spec.rb` | Karafka should correctly report consumption_lag when there is a delay in between publishing messages and their consumption |
| `lags/consumption_real_time_spec.rb` | Karafka should correctly report consumption_lag when we consume messages fast and it should never be bigger than couple hundred ms with the defaults for integration specs |
| `lags/processing_fast_spec.rb` | When processing data fast, the processing lag should not be big and things should be processed almost real time |
| `lags/processing_not_enough_threads_spec.rb` | In case there are not enough threads to parallelize work from multiple topics/partitions we can expect a processing lag, as work will wait in a queue to be picked up once resources are available |
| `lags/processing_slow_spec.rb` | When processing data slowly from a single partition of a single topic, we do not fetch more data from Kafka, thus the processing lag should not be big as there is no more data enqueued We keep the time numbers a bit higher than they could be as when running on the CI, sometimes there are small lags |
| `offset_management/commit_offset_after_exceeding_max_poll_spec.rb` | When we exceed max poll interval but did not poll yet, the async and sync offset commits should give us accurate representation of the ownership because of lost assignment check. |
| `offset_management/commit_offset_sync_when_no_offsets_spec.rb` | When we do not have any offsets committed, `store_offsets` and `store_offsets\!` should work as expected. `store_offsets\!` can be useful in cases when we do want to delegate the offset management to Karafka but still want to make sure that upon consumption start we own the assignment. In such cases `store_offsets\!` give us good knowledge of it. |
| `offset_management/from_latest_via_initial_offset_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to start consuming from the latest offset whe set via initial_offset |
| `offset_management/from_latest_via_kafka_setting_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to start consuming from the latest offset |
| `offset_management/messages_and_metadata_details_spec.rb` | Karafka messages data should be as defined here |
| `offset_management/offset_edge_cases_spec.rb` | Karafka should handle offset management edge cases properly |
| `offset_management/rebalance_commit_spec.rb` | Karafka flushes the offsets once in a while. When auto offset committing is disabled, we anyhow should commit the offset in rebalance |
| `offset_management/with_different_initial_offsets_many_groups_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to consume many topics with different initial offset strategies and should handle that correctly for all the topics in many groups |
| `offset_management/with_different_initial_offsets_one_group_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to consume many topics with different initial offset strategies and should handle that correctly for all the topics |
| `offset_management/with_marking_older_message_spec.rb` | When older message then the one we already marked is marked as processed, this should be ignored. We should only mark stuff moving forward. This aligns with librdkafka behaviour for offsets (see note): https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/master/INTRODUCTION.md#at-least-once-processing |
| `offset_management/with_sync_marking_spec.rb` | Karafka should not raise any errors when we use mark_as_consumed\! |
| `pausing/manual_pause_on_a_revoked_partition_spec.rb` | When we pause a lost partition, it should not have any impact on us getting the data after we get it back (if we get it back) |
| `pausing/overwrite_one_pause_with_another_spec.rb` | Even if we are in a long active pause, a short pause should overwrite the long one |
| `pausing/pause_and_continue_without_offset_spec.rb` | We should be able to pause without any arguments and then pause will pause on the consecutive offset |
| `pausing/pause_early_and_skip_via_marking_spec.rb` | We should be able to pause the partition and still mark messages as consumed When another process would pick up the work, it should start from the last consumption marked |
| `pausing/pause_early_and_skip_via_seek_spec.rb` | We should be able to pause the partition and then seek to another offset After partition is un-paused, it should skip the messages we want to jump over |
| `pausing/pause_early_and_skip_when_resume_seek_spec.rb` | We should be able to pause the partition and then seek to another offset before we un-pause After partition is un-paused, it should skip the messages we want to jump over |
| `pausing/pause_prior_to_automatic_offset_and_mark_spec.rb` | When user pauses and marks by himself, we should not deal with this and let him do this. |
| `pausing/pause_prior_to_automatic_offset_spec.rb` | When user initiates a pause, the automatic offset management should not mark the last batch message as consumed automatically to prevent a scenario, where upon a rebalance during the pause the partition is gave away and processing starts now from the last offset prior to pause but from the automatic offset. |
| `pausing/pause_super_short_spec.rb` | When we pause for a time shorter than processing time, we should un-pause prior to the next poll We should not exceed two polls. First (before which we resume) may not get the data because after resuming we may not have enough time to start polling the given partition again. |
| `pausing/pausing_with_message_skip_spec.rb` | We should be able to pause the partition in a way that would allow us to skip a message. This is not something you want to do in production, nonetheless use-case like this should be supported. |
| `pausing/prolonging_manual_pause_spec.rb` | We should be able to prolong a manual pause that we did pause already and the times should add up |
| `pausing/seeking_offset_after_pausing_spec.rb` | After we pause and continue processing, we should be able to seek to previous offset and after un-pausing, we should be able to start from where we wanted (not from where we paused) |
| `pausing/using_manual_pause_with_backoff_defaults_spec.rb` | Important: this may not work as expected for a manual pause case. Please read the below message. When we pause a partition without providing the timeout, it should use the timeout defined in the retry settings. The case here is, that when processing is successful we reset the pause counter, so the retry is never acknowledged (like it is for cases with errors). This means that manual pausing will never use the automatic exponential backoff. |
| `pausing/using_manual_pause_with_non_backoff_defaults_spec.rb` | When we pause a partition without providing the timeout, it should use the timeout defined in the retry settings |
| `pausing/with_manual_pause_and_other_partitions_working_spec.rb` | When one partition is paused by us manually, we should be consuming others without interruption. Here we check, that the paused partition data is consumed as last (since we pause long enough) and that the other partition's data was consumed first. |
| `pausing/with_manual_pause_in_between_messages_spec.rb` | We should be able to manually pause for any time we want, bypassing the default pause time if we declare the pause time ourselves. |
| `pausing/with_manual_pause_same_message_loop_spec.rb` | We should be able pause on a message we've already seen from the batch and should always start from it after resuming. This will mean, we just process same message over and over again. |
| `pausing/with_pause_and_resume_after_reclaim_spec.rb` | We can pause and after revocation and re-claim we should continue processing like pause did not happen. We should not keep the pause after a rebalance. Messages that were consumed by another process should not be re-consumed. |
| `pausing/with_pause_and_resume_spec.rb` | We should be able to do things like pausing and resume in the same consumer flow. This should not break the ordering |
| `pro/cli/declaratives/ignore_patterns_in_declaratives_spec.rb` | karafka declarative topics management should ignore pattern topics because they are dynamic subscriptions for which we do not know the target name until the regexp match |
| `pro/cli/declaratives/strict_setup_requirement_spec.rb` | When we have strict_declarative_topics set to true, we should ensure all non-pattern definitions of topics have their declarative references |
| `pro/cli/parallel_segments/collapse/with_conclusive_offsets_spec.rb` | Karafka parallel segments collapse should work when there is a topic that was consumed with parallel segments and their offset assignment is even |
| `pro/cli/parallel_segments/collapse/with_force_and_inconclusive_offsets_spec.rb` | Karafka parallel segments collapse should work with --force when offsets are inconclusive by picking the lowest offset for each partition |

| `pro/cli/parallel_segments/distribute/without_segments_spec.rb` | Karafka parallel segments distribute should work when there are no segments to distribute |
| `pro/cli/parallel_segments/invalid_action_spec.rb` | Karafka parallel segments should fail with ArgumentError when an invalid action is provided |
| `pro/cli/parallel_segments/reset_combined_operation_spec.rb` | Karafka parallel segments reset should perform both collapse and distribute operations |
| `pro/cli/swarm/with_cg_exclusion_spec.rb` | Karafka in swarm should properly handle consumer group exclusion flag and skip processing the specified consumer groups |
| `pro/cli/swarm/with_cg_inclusion_spec.rb` | Karafka in swarm should properly handle consumer group inclusion flag and only process the specified consumer groups |
| `pro/cli/swarm/with_nothing_matching_spec.rb` | Karafka in swarm should raise well nested validated errors with the swarm context |
| `pro/cli/swarm/with_sg_exclusion_spec.rb` | Karafka in swarm should raise well nested validated errors with the swarm context This spec will cause it to crash if any validation that would fail is happening in the nodes post-fork |
| `pro/cli/swarm/with_sg_inclusion_spec.rb` | Karafka in swarm should properly handle subscription group inclusion flag and only process the specified subscription groups |
| `pro/cli/swarm/with_topic_exclusion_spec.rb` | Karafka in swarm should properly handle topic exclusion flag and skip processing the specified topics |
| `pro/cli/swarm/with_topic_inclusion_spec.rb` | Karafka in swarm should properly handle topic inclusion flag and only process the specified topics |
| `pro/consumption/adaptive_iterator/with_adaptive_estimated_processing_limited_spec.rb` | With adaptive margin, if the max cost of message would cause reaching max poll, we should seek back |
| `pro/consumption/adaptive_iterator/with_fast_exit_on_stop_spec.rb` | We should stop fast and not process all in batch and offset position should be preserved |
| `pro/consumption/adaptive_iterator/without_adaptive_stable_processing_limited_spec.rb` | When processing messages with iterator enabled and reaching max.poll.interval, we should never get any errors and processing should be consecutive |
| `pro/consumption/adaptive_iterator/without_anything_running_spec.rb` | When processing messages with iterator enabled but no features enabled, it should work |
| `pro/consumption/at_most_once_on_error_spec.rb` | When marking as consumed before the error, message should be skipped as it should be considered consumed |
| `pro/consumption/cleaner/automatic_cleaning_on_iterator_spec.rb` | We should be able to use automatic cleaning to get rid of the payload We should fail when trying to deserialize a cleaned message |
| `pro/consumption/cleaner/external_prepend_compatibility_spec.rb` | We should be able to use cleaning functionality even when external libraries prepend modules to Messages#each (like DataDog tracing) This tests the fix for: https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-rb/issues/4867 |
| `pro/consumption/cleaner/fail_on_dlq_dispatch_of_cleaned_spec.rb` | Attempt to dispatch to DLQ a cleaned message should always fail |
| `pro/consumption/cleaner/manual_cleaning_on_each_spec.rb` | We should be able to iterate over messages and run cleaning both with and without prior deserialization in a manual mode We should fail when trying to deserialize a cleaned message |
| `pro/consumption/cleaner/metadata_cleaning_on_iterator_spec.rb` | We should be able to use automatic cleaning to get rid of the key and headers We should fail when trying to deserialize a cleaned details |
| `pro/consumption/cleaner/without_metadata_spec.rb` | We should be able to clean only payload when needed |
| `pro/consumption/direct_assignments/all_partitions_spec.rb` | We should be able to assign to ourselves direct ownership of all partitions |
| `pro/consumption/direct_assignments/beyond_poll_interval_spec.rb` | When using direct assignments, we should be able to ignore max poll interval. |
| `pro/consumption/direct_assignments/from_earliest_spec.rb` | We should be able to assign to ourselves direct ownership of partitions we are interested in |
| `pro/consumption/direct_assignments/marking_as_consumed_spec.rb` | We should be able to mark as consumed |
| `pro/consumption/direct_assignments/multi_topic_in_one_cg_spec.rb` | We should be able to assign to ourselves multiple topics in one CG |
| `pro/consumption/direct_assignments/multi_topic_stream_merging_spec.rb` | When using direct assignments, we should be able to maintain a window and merge data from several streams Note, that this example is a simplification and does not take into consideration lags caused by sudden data spikes in one of the topics. It aims to illustrate the basics of stream merging. What we do here is simple: we publish users creation events and we publish their actions events Events cannot happen before user is created but since we have two topics, their delivery times may vary. We merge those two topics and dispatch the target data into "users_events" target topic This example is simplified. Offset management is not correct for production-grade flow. |
| `pro/consumption/direct_assignments/multi_topic_transactional_spec.rb` | We should be able to open a multi-topic transaction as long as we know which consumer is the source of underlying messages so we can track their offsets This works with an assumption that we have one producer @note There is code for consumer marking commented out because we want to ensure, that we mark as consumed only in the transaction and that it works as expected but in a production-grade system you also want to always synchronize internal state of consumers instances. |
| `pro/consumption/direct_assignments/starting_from_where_it_left_spec.rb` | We should start from where the offset was with direct assignments |
| `pro/consumption/direct_assignments/transactions_support_spec.rb` | We should be able to assign what we want and mark offsets in a transaction |
| `pro/consumption/eofed/vps_with_eof_spec.rb` | When using virtual partitions with eof, each VP should receive its own `#eofed` execution. |
| `pro/consumption/fast_non_blocking_unlock_spec.rb` | Because when we set time based locks that can bypass default ticking, we should be able to jump over ticking faster that the ticking interval We do not not instrument wait unlocks on the queue but since listener events are published, we can use next poll start to notice that it unlocks faster than the tick interval but slower than post-job immediate unlock |
| `pro/consumption/from_earliest_direct_iterator_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to easily consume all the messages from earliest (default) exactly the same way with pro as it does without |
| `pro/consumption/from_earliest_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to easily consume all the messages from earliest (default) exactly the same way with pro as it does without |
| `pro/consumption/inline_insights/from_earliest_required_spec.rb` | When insights are required, we should not proceed without them Because initial metrics fetch is slightly unpredictable (different with KRaft) and can be impacted by the cpu load, we simulate lack by patching the tracker so first first 10 seconds of running the process it returns no data |
| `pro/consumption/inline_insights/from_earliest_spec.rb` | We should be able to get the insights and use them via the API when they are defined In Pro despite extra option, should behave same as in OSS when no forced required |
| `pro/consumption/inline_insights/multi_topic_partition_spec.rb` | Inline Insights should ship correct partition and topic details and not mix them In Pro despite extra option, should behave same as in OSS when no forced required |
| `pro/consumption/inline_insights/post_involuntary_revocation_spec.rb` | When given partition is lost involuntary, we still should have last info In Pro despite extra option, should behave same as in OSS when no forced required |
| `pro/consumption/inline_insights/post_revocation_insights_lrj_spec.rb` | When given partition is revoked for LRJ, we should still have its last available statistics In Pro despite extra option, should behave same as in OSS when no forced required |
| `pro/consumption/inline_insights/without_being_enabled_spec.rb` | Karafka should not have the insights methods when insights are not enabled In Pro despite extra option, should behave same as in OSS when no forced required |
| `pro/consumption/multiplexing/dynamic_downscale_spec.rb` | When we start from too many connections, we should effectively go down and establish baseline |
| `pro/consumption/multiplexing/dynamic_pristine/upscale_to_big_setup_spec.rb` | This is a special spec that ensures librdkafka stability It is related to multiplexing that's why it is here. This spec covers this case: https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka/issues/4783 This spec runs 1.5 minute but it is expected to ensure stability of the multiplexing execution If the issue persists, this process will fail. This spec needs to run alone because otherwise the `top` command result can be biased by other specs running on the same machine alongside |
| `pro/consumption/multiplexing/dynamic_with_max_start_spec.rb` | When we start from max connections but there is is no space to grow, we should keep it and not downscale |
| `pro/consumption/multiplexing/dynamic_with_mid_start_spec.rb` | When we start from few connections but there is space to grow, we should |
| `pro/consumption/multiplexing/dynamic_with_min_start_spec.rb` | When we start from one connection but there is space to grow, we should |
| `pro/consumption/multiplexing/static_with_many_topics_and_partitions_spec.rb` | We should be able to have static group membership with cooperative on many topics and partitions with multiplexing starting with 1 without any issues. |
| `pro/consumption/multiplexing/with_patterns_spec.rb` | We should be able to multiplex a pattern and things should operate as expected |
| `pro/consumption/multiplexing/with_same_topic_in_multiple_subscription_groups_spec.rb` | When using separate subscription groups, each should have it's own underlying client and should operate independently for data fetching and consumption |
| `pro/consumption/offset_metadata/basic_automatic_flow_overwritten_last_marking_spec.rb` | When offset metadata is stored and we mark each, later marking as consumed on the same location should not end up with us loosing metadata |
| `pro/consumption/offset_metadata/basic_automatic_flow_overwritten_spec.rb` | When offset metadata is stored but a custom forced value is used, the forced on should be used. |
| `pro/consumption/offset_metadata/basic_automatic_flow_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to take the offset from the `store_metadata_offset` invocation and use it |
| `pro/consumption/offset_metadata/basic_flow_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to get offset metadata when non-existing, save it and force refresh with defaults and cache on @note We use mark_as_consumed\! to instantly flush |
| `pro/consumption/offset_metadata/dlq/recovery_with_metadata_spec.rb` | When stored metadata exists, it should be used in the DLQ flow. |
| `pro/consumption/offset_metadata/ftr/usage_from_filter_spec.rb` | Karafka should allow for usage of the offset metadata from filters as well. Since filters can accept routing topic and partition reference from the builder, they can store them and use the fetcher to obtain needed offset metadata. This can allow them to use the pre-rebalance context awareness. |
| `pro/consumption/offset_metadata/iterative_marking_cached_flow_spec.rb` | Offset should move forward with metadata but because we cache result, it should not update in memory as there is no rebalance. |
| `pro/consumption/offset_metadata/iterative_marking_no_cache_flow_spec.rb` | Offset should move forward with metadata and should be deserialized with a custom deserializer. Because we disabled the cache completely, we should get linear auto-refreshed data |
| `pro/consumption/offset_metadata/rebalanced_cache_refresh_spec.rb` | When rebalance occurs, even if we had cache, it should be invalidated |
| `pro/consumption/offset_metadata/vp/current_matching_spec.rb` | When we use current matching strategy on the given offset that can be materialized, it should use the most recently used offset metadata even if it was assigned to a different offset |
| `pro/consumption/offset_metadata/vp/exact_automatic_offset_with_marked_already_spec.rb` | When we mark as consumed everything, automatic marking should not overwrite the metadata |
| `pro/consumption/offset_metadata/vp/exact_matching_spec.rb` | When we use exact matching strategy on the given offset that can be materialized, it should be used even if later we use a different higher that cannot be materialized |
| `pro/consumption/offset_metadata/vp/exact_with_higher_matching_on_spec.rb` | When we use exact matching strategy for virtual partitions, metadata should match the most recent consecutive offset and not the latest marking offset kept in-memory In case materialized offset is behind the one that we marked due to the VPs distribution, "exact" value will be assigned from the highest offset of a virtual partition |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/basic_distribution_flow_spec.rb` | Messages should be distributed to consumers based on their group_id assignment using the partitioner and reducer |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/error_recovery_flow_spec.rb` | After errors, consumers should be able to recover and continue processing in their assigned groups without receiving messages from other groups |

| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/mom/without_offset_marking_spec.rb` | With manual offset management, no offsets should be automatically marked even when all messages are filtered |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_active_job/job_distribution_spec.rb` | ActiveJob jobs should be distributed to consumers based on their segment group assignment |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_all_filtered_offset_marking_spec.rb` | When all messages are filtered out, offsets should be marked as consumed to prevent lag |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_dlq/error_dispatching_flow_spec.rb` | Error dispatching to DLQ should respect the parallel segment group assignment using segment-specific DLQ topics |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_dlq/filtered_message_handling_spec.rb` | Filtered messages from parallel segments should not be sent to DLQ as they are part of normal operation |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_dynamic_partitioner_spec.rb` | Dynamic partitioners should be able to change distribution rules mid-flow and consumers should adapt |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_error_in_partitioner_spec.rb` | Errors in partitioner should be properly handled and should not crash the consumer |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_error_in_reducer_spec.rb` | Errors in reducer should be properly handled and should not crash the consumer |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_full_batch_filtering_auto_marking_spec.rb` | With automatic offset management, offsets should be marked even when all messages are filtered |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_long_running_jobs/processing_continuity_spec.rb` | Long-running jobs should maintain their parallel segment group assignment throughout execution |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_long_running_jobs/rebalance_continuity_spec.rb` | During rebalancing, long-running jobs should maintain their parallel segment assignments |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_long_running_jobs/revoke_continuity_spec.rb` | After partition revocation, reacquired partitions should resume with consistent parallel segment assignment |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_many_groups_distribution_spec.rb` | With many segment groups, distribution should remain balanced and consistent with the reducer formula |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_many_topics_in_the_consumer_group_spec.rb` | With many topics in the consumer group, they all should work correctly and work should be distributed as expected. |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_nil_key_handling_spec.rb` | Messages with nil keys should be handled gracefully and assigned to a consistent group |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_pattern_matched_topics_spec.rb` | Parallel segments should work correctly with dynamically matched topics from patterns |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_rebalancing_spec.rb` | During rebalancing, parallel segment assignment should remain consistent for the same messages |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_throttling_spec.rb` | Throttling should be applied per parallel segment group rather than globally |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_transactions/offset_marking_continuity_spec.rb` | Offset marking within transactions should maintain continuity in parallel segments |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_transactions/with_aborted_transaction_spec.rb` | When a transaction is aborted, the parallel segments should handle this properly without marking offsets |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_uneven_distribution_spec.rb` | Even with uneven distribution, each consumer should only process messages for its assigned group |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_virtual_partitions/combined_distribution_flow_spec.rb` | When using both features, messages should first be distributed by parallel segments then by virtual partitions |
| `pro/consumption/parallel_segments/with_virtual_partitions/nested_partitioning_spec.rb` | Virtual partitions should correctly subdivide workloads within parallel segment groups |
| `pro/consumption/patterns/complex_regexp_match_spec.rb` | Karafka should match over complex regexp as long as they comply with the following format: https://github.com/ccxvii/minilibs/blob/master/regexp.c |

| `pro/consumption/patterns/post_detected_with_default_deserializers_spec.rb` | Karafka should use default deserializers when defaults exist and topic is detected |
| `pro/consumption/patterns/postfix_match_spec.rb` | Karafka should match over postfix regexp |
| `pro/consumption/patterns/prefix_match_spec.rb` | Karafka should match over postfix regexp |
| `pro/consumption/patterns/unexpected_patterns_loop_spec.rb` | When consumer uses patterns and same pattern matches the DLQ, messages may be self-consumed creating endless loop. Not something you want. |
| `pro/consumption/patterns/with_matching_appearing_topic_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to match non-existing topic when it appears later on. |
| `pro/consumption/patterns/with_matching_existing_topic_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to match existing topic with pattern when starting processing and given topic already exists |
| `pro/consumption/patterns/with_multiple_existing_topics_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to match existing topics when regexp specifies all of them No rebalances should occur in between detections |

| `pro/consumption/periodic_jobs/during_error_spec.rb` | By default ticking should not happen if we are in a recovery flow |
| `pro/consumption/periodic_jobs/during_error_with_recovery_spec.rb` | If we explicitely want to tick during recovery, it should be possible |
| `pro/consumption/periodic_jobs/filtering/on_constant_idle_spec.rb` | When we idle all the time on incoming data, we should never tick It is end user FTR makes this decision to skip |
| `pro/consumption/periodic_jobs/filtering/on_idle_and_nothing_spec.rb` | When we idle all and move on but no more messages for a while, tick should kick in |

| `pro/consumption/strategies/ftr/with_manual_pause_spec.rb` | Karafka should favour a manual pause over throttling and take appropriate action when the pause has expired. So if we've reached throttling threshold and paused, after the manual pause is over, we should pause and not process We also should not have any duplicates and processing should be smooth |

| `pro/consumption/strategies/lrj/default/no_revocation_on_low_concurrency_spec.rb` | When running LRJ with low concurrency and many LRJ topics, we should not be kicked out of the consumer group after reaching the interval. Pausing should happen prior to processing and it should ensure that all new LRJ topics and partitions assigned are paused even when there are no available workers to do the work. |
| `pro/consumption/strategies/lrj/default/parallel_non_lrj_with_lrj_spec.rb` | When using LRJ within a consumer group with other non-LRJ, the LRJ should be running while other jobs are consumed and they should not wait (as long as enough workers) |

Messages with the same key are processed together 2. Larger groups are processed first 3. Messages within each group maintain their order 4. Work is distributed across available workers Please note, that cross-batch VP assignment is not guaranteed with this distribution strategy. |

| `pro/consumption/strategies/vp/collapsing/collapse_and_continuity_spec.rb` | Karafka when with VP upon error should collapse the whole collective batch and should continue processing in the collapsed mode after a back-off until all the "infected" messages are done. After that, VPs should be resumed. |
| `pro/consumption/strategies/vp/collapsing/collapse_with_intermediate_marking_filtering_spec.rb` | After we collapse, we should skip messages we marked as consumed, except those that were not processed. |
| `pro/consumption/strategies/vp/collapsing/continuous_retry_in_collabse_with_filtering_spec.rb` | When we continue to have an error on the same event in the collapse mode, others should be filtered for as long as the collapse lasts. |
| `pro/consumption/strategies/vp/collapsing/manual_collapse_and_continuity_spec.rb` | Karafka when with VPs should support manual collapsing. After we explicitely collapse VPs, the collapse should continue for as long as we wanted |

| `pro/consumption/strategies/vp/collapsing/with_pause_on_collapsed_spec.rb` | While VPs do not support pausing in the regular flow, we can pause while running VP when collapsed. This can be used to provide a manual back-off if we would want. |
| `pro/consumption/strategies/vp/collective_state_awareness_break_spec.rb` | We should be able to use `#failing?` to detect, that part of our work has already failed and that our current set of VPs will collapse. This can be used to stop processing when we know, it is going to be re-processed again |
| `pro/consumption/strategies/vp/consistent_distribution_spec.rb` | Karafka should always assign same consumer instance to the same virtual partitioner result. In case data from few virtual partitions is merged into one chunk, the partition should always stay the same (consistent). |
| `pro/consumption/strategies/vp/custom_expensive_message_scheduling_spec.rb` | This integration test demonstrates how to override the default LJF (Longest Job First) scheduling algorithm to implement custom logic that identifies and prioritizes Virtual Partitions containing expensive messages. This ensures expensive messages are processed first, allowing them to run in parallel with other messages rather than blocking at the end. Real-world scenario: In production, some messages require extensive processing (1+ minute) while others complete quickly (<1 second). With Virtual Partitions and limited worker threads, default LJF scheduling might not optimally handle this, causing idle workers while the expensive message blocks progress. |
| `pro/consumption/strategies/vp/custom_partitioning_engine_spec.rb` | When using Pro, we should be able to redefine and change the whole partitioner and use our own custom one without any problems. This spec illustrated, that you can overwrite the core partitioner and use your own that distributes work differently for different topics with awareness of the received batch size. |

| `pro/consumption/strategies/vp/distributing_work_randomly_spec.rb` | Karafka should support possibility of distributing work randomly when using virtual partitions Note that even when using random distribution, messages from different partitions will never mix within a batch. |
| `pro/consumption/strategies/vp/distributing_work_using_message_keys_spec.rb` | Karafka should support possibility of using message keys to distribute work We have two partitions but virtual partitioner should allow us to distribute this work across four threads concurrently. Note that you can get different combinations of messages for different batches fetched. The fact that the first time messages with key `a` were together with `c`, does not mean, that it will always be the same. The distribution combination is unique for the batch. One thing you can be sure, is that if you have messages with key `c`, they will always go to one of the virtual consumers. Virtual consumer instance is **not** warrantied. |
| `pro/consumption/strategies/vp/empty_and_nil_keys_spec.rb` | Virtual partitions should handle edge cases with empty keys, nil keys, and keys that result in invalid partitioning scenarios without crashing the consumer. |

| `pro/consumption/strategies/vp/pausing_concurrently_spec.rb` | When we invoke pause from multiple VPs, the last one should win |
| `pro/consumption/strategies/vp/pre_work_marking_retry_continuity_spec.rb` | After an error, in case we marked before the processing, we should just skip the broken and move on as we should just filter out broken one. |
| `pro/consumption/strategies/vp/regular_processing_one_by_one_without_errors_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to just process all the messages one after another |
| `pro/consumption/strategies/vp/round_robin_with_direct_reducer_spec.rb` | When using a round-robin partitioner, Karafka should assign messages correctly to utilize all VPs. We test two instances to make sure that they operate independently Since the default reducer does not work perfectly with all concurrency settings, we can use a custom reducer to match the virtual key with partitions 1:1. |
| `pro/consumption/strategies/vp/shared_coordinator_spec.rb` | Karafka should use the same coordinator for all the jobs in a group |
| `pro/consumption/strategies/vp/synchronized_with_marking_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to run marking from a synchronization block and not crash despite using the same lock. This ensures, that user can run synchronized code that will also mark and that our internal synchronization is aligned with it. |
| `pro/consumption/strategies/vp/with_cycling_distribution_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to evenly distribute work when using a cycling partitioner Since we do not have multiple partitions/topics in this example, there are no locks around it, but in complex cases there should be a more complex cycling engine |

| `pro/rails/active_job/long_running_jobs/fast_spec.rb` | Fast jobs should also not have any problems (though not recommended) when running as lrj |
| `pro/rails/active_job/long_running_jobs/with_error_spec.rb` | When we have an lrj job and it fails, it should use regular Karafka retry policies |
| `pro/rails/active_job/long_running_jobs/with_revocation_spec.rb` | When we have a batch of ActiveJobs jobs and we loose our partition assignment, jobs that did not start prior to the revocation should not start at all.

| `pro/rails/active_job/virtual_partitions/with_revocation_spec.rb` | When we have a batch of ActiveJobs jobs and we loose our partition assignment, jobs that did not start prior to the revocation should not start at all. To simulate this we will have jobs on two partitions in parallel and we will "loose" one of them and detect this. We need to make consumption jobs long enough to jump with a rebalance in the middle. Since we internally mark as consumed on each job, we can be aware of revocation early enough. We need to run in an LRJ mode to make this happen, so rebalance does not block revocation. Note that for LRJ + VP, under shutdown we need to finish processing all because otherwise we might end up having extensive reprocessing |

| `rebalancing/constant_rebalance_continuity_spec.rb` | When we consume data and several times we loose and regain partition, there should be continuity in what messages we pick up even if rebalances happens multiple times We may re-fetch certain messages but none should be skipped |
| `rebalancing/cooperative_sticky_full_spec.rb` | When marking as consumed during rebalance on cooperative-sticky, it will reject this marking and will work as expected (not revoking all). It was fixed in librdkafka 2.10 @note Prior to librdkafka 2.10 this is how it worked: Karafka will run a full rebalance in case we use cooperative-sticky but force commit when rebalance happens. This is how `librdkafka` works |
| `rebalancing/cooperative_sticky_immediate_stop_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to stop even before the initial rebalance and should not crash @see https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka/issues/4312 We can get a forceful shutdown here when we decide to close before actually polling and triggering a rebalance We ignore it because here we check if the whole process does not crash due to librdkafka issue |
| `rebalancing/cooperative_sticky_spec.rb` | Karafka should support a cooperative-sticky rebalance strategy without any problems |
| `rebalancing/cooperative_sticky_unassigned_shutdown_spec.rb` | Karafka should shutdown cooperative-sticky after first rebalance, even if the rebalance did not grant any assignments to Karafka We have one partition that we assign to a different consumer and then start karafka that should not get the assignment. Despite that it should close gracefully because it did went through one (empty) rebalance. |
| `rebalancing/cooperative_sticky_without_assignment_spec.rb` | When work already happens somewhere else and cooperative-sticky kicks in, we should not get the assignment but an event should propagate from the rebalance nonetheless |
| `rebalancing/coordinator_replacement_after_rebalance_spec.rb` | Karafka should replace coordinator for consumer of a given topic partition after partition was taken away from us and assigned back |
| `rebalancing/exceeding_max_poll_interval_spec.rb` | When processing beyond the poll interval, we should be kicked out and we should loose the assigned partition. The revocation job should kick in with a proper revoked state. |
| `rebalancing/exceeding_max_poll_with_fast_commit_spec.rb` | When processing beyond the poll interval, with fast offset commit, we should pick up from where we left without duplicates |
| `rebalancing/exceeding_max_poll_with_late_commit_spec.rb` | When processing beyond the poll interval, with slower offset commit, we will restart processing and there should be duplicated messages. |
| `rebalancing/kip_848/configurable_remote_assignor_spec.rb` | Test that KIP-848 works with configurable remote assignor The new consumer protocol supports different server-side assignors like 'uniform' and 'range' |

| `rebalancing/kip_848/multiple_groups_spec.rb` | Test multiple consumer groups using the new KIP-848 consumer group protocol This ensures different consumer groups can consume the same topic independently |
| `rebalancing/kip_848/newly_joined_fencing_spec.rb` | Test rebalancing with KIP-848 by verifying that new consumer joining with same group instance id should be fenced If new consumer is not fenced, it will run forever and spec will timeout |
| `rebalancing/kip_848/rebalancing_spec.rb` | Test rebalancing with KIP-848 by verifying partition assignment changes when a second consumer joins the group |
| `rebalancing/kip_848/simple_spec.rb` | Test that KIP-848 consumer group protocol works with basic consumption |
| `rebalancing/kip_848/static_membership_spec.rb` | Test that static group membership works correctly with KIP-848 consumer protocol Static membership allows a consumer to maintain its partition assignment across restarts |
| `rebalancing/lifecycle_events_spec.rb` | When rebalance occurs, we should go through all the proper lifecycle events and only for the subscription group for which rebalance occurs. Details should be present and second group should be intact. |
| `rebalancing/lost_partition_revoked_execution_time_spec.rb` | When partition is lost but our job is still running, it should be allowed to finish work and should not run while code execution is still running. Revocation code should wait on the whole job to finish before running `#revoked`. @note This works differently in the Pro LRJ. |
| `rebalancing/message_order_with_sync_commit_spec.rb` | Messages should not be reprocessed out of order during a rebalance triggered by an unhealthy consumer with additional manual synchronous commits using #mark_as_consumed\!. |
| `rebalancing/message_order_without_sync_commit_spec.rb` | Messages can be reprocessed out of order during a rebalance triggered by an unhealthy consumer without additional manual synchronous commits. |
| `rebalancing/multiple_consumer_groups_stability_spec.rb` | When using multiple consumer groups and when one is rebalanced, it should not affect the one that was not a rebalance subject |
| `rebalancing/on_partition_data_revoked_spec.rb` | Karafka should trigger a revoked action when a partition is being taken from us Initially we should own all the partitions and then after they are taken away, we should get back to two (as the last one will be owned by the second consumer). |
| `rebalancing/revoke_continuity_spec.rb` | When Karafka looses a given partition but later gets it back, it should pick it up from the last offset committed without any problems |
| `rebalancing/revoke_reclaim_continuity_spec.rb` | When a consumer goes into a non-cooperative-sticky rebalance and gets the partitions back, it should not have duplicated data. |
| `rebalancing/stop_when_revoked_and_continue_spec.rb` | When given partition was revoked, we should be able to stop processing and it should not affect other consumers from consuming. On the other hand, when we get back what we have lost, we should be able to get going and we should not have to process what was processed by others. |
| `rebalancing/stored_reclaimed_continuity_cooperative_spec.rb` | When consumer looses the partition but later on gets it back, it should not have duplicates as long as marking always happened (which is the case in this scenario) There also should be no duplicates |
| `rebalancing/stored_reclaimed_continuity_spec.rb` | When consumer looses the partition but later on gets it back, it should not have duplicates as long as marking always happened (which is the case in this scenario) There also should be no duplicates |
| `rebalancing/voluntary_revocation_spec.rb` | When we are not kicked out forcefully but a legit rebalance occurs, we should not be marked as revoked when running tasks prior to reassignments. |
| `rebalancing/with_static_membership_reconnect_spec.rb` | Karafka process when stopped and started and configured with static membership should pick up the assigned work. It should not be reassigned to a different process. Karafka should maintain all the ordering and should not have duplicated. |
| `rebalancing/without_using_revoked_partition_data_spec.rb` | Karafka should not use data that was fetched partially for a partition that was lost in the same consumer instance that was revoked. There should be new instance created. New consumer instance should pick it up keeping continuity with the previous batch. When rebalance occurs and we're in the middle of data polling, data from a lost partition should be rejected as it is going to be picked up by a different process / instance. We simulate lost partition by starting a second consumer that will trigger a rebalance. |

| `routing/consumer_group_reopening_pristine/multi_file_spec.rb` | This pristine spec simulates the real-world scenario from GitHub issue #2363 where routing configuration is split across multiple files, each defining topics in the same consumer group. Directory structure: - routes/users_routes.rb  - defines topics in a shared consumer group - routes/orders_routes.rb - reopens the same consumer group with more topics - consumers/              - consumer implementations Expected behavior: All topics should accumulate in the same consumer group, allowing for modular routing configuration. |
| `routing/different_cluster_consumer_groups_spec.rb` | Karafka should allow for defining separate consumer groups that will talk with separate clusters Distribution in subscription groups should match same cluster with same settings |

| `routing/stable_with_subscription_groups_spec.rb` | Building subscription groups multiple times should not change their static group membership ids as long as topics structure is unchanged. |
| `routing/topic_custom_attributes_spec.rb` | You should be able to define your own features to assign them to topics You should also be able to use it from the consumer |
| `routing/topic_pattern_matching_spec.rb` | Karafka should handle topic routing patterns and naming edge cases |
| `routing/valid_with_features_usage_spec.rb` | Karafka should auto-load all the routing features |

| `routing/with_per_topic_consumer_persistence_spec.rb` | We should be able to disable consumer persistence for all the topics by default but at the same time we should be able to customize things in a per topic basis. This can be useful when injecting extensions/plugins that would use routing. For example our Web-UI despite dev not having persistence needs to have persistence in order to be able to materialize and compute the states correctly |

| `seek/to_a_given_offset_from_consumer_on_higher_partition_spec.rb` | Karafka should be able to easily consume from a given offset, instead of starting from 0. Karafka makes sure, we do not process in parallel incoming data from the same partition ahead, so we can easily rewind the offset and then the client queue will be cleared. What that means is that we do not have to worry beyond our current batch. It is worth keeping in mind, that in order for this to work, the current consumption process need to happen from the "previous" offset before seeking. Otherwise consumer instance won't be initialized |

Karafka makes sure, we do not process in parallel incoming data from the same partition ahead, so we can easily rewind the offset and then the client queue will be cleared. What that means is that we do not have to worry beyond our current batch.

| `setup/with_custom_worker_thread_priority_spec.rb` | When reconfiguring the worker thread priority, worker threads should have proper priority set When reconfiguring internal listener worker thread priority, it should also work |
| `setup/with_kip_848_protocol_incorrect_config_spec.rb` | Karafka should crash when new and old rebalance protocol settings are mixed even if independently they are correct. Note that those errors only happen upon subscription, not during configuration. |
| `setup/with_patched_object_spec.rb` | *No description available* |

| `shutdown/extremely_fast_stop_spec.rb` | When we stop right after run, it should not hang even on extreme edge cases |
| `shutdown/fast_shutdown_on_long_polling_spec.rb` | Karafka should not wait full long polling cycle when shutdown is issued due to fast circuit breaker flow. No assertions are needed as it will just wait forever if not working correctly |
| `shutdown/on_hanging_jobs_and_a_shutdown_spec.rb` | When Karafka is being shutdown and the consumer is hanging, it should force a shutdown |
| `shutdown/on_hanging_listener_and_shutdown_spec.rb` | When Karafka is being shutdown and the consumer thread is hanging for too long, it should force a shutdown despite having active connections to Kafka |
