# Karafka Naming Conventions

!!! Info "Convention Migration in Progress"
  
    The Karafka ecosystem is currently in the process of adopting these naming conventions. You may encounter inconsistencies in existing documentation, code examples, or library implementations that haven't been updated yet.

    If you notice any naming inconsistencies in the documentation, code examples, or Karafka codebase that don't follow these conventions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/issues) with details. Your feedback helps us maintain consistency across the entire ecosystem.

This document establishes comprehensive naming conventions for the Karafka ecosystem. Consistent naming improves code readability, maintainability, and team collaboration while ensuring alignment with broader Kafka community practices.

## Overview

Naming conventions serve several critical purposes:

| Purpose | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Consistency** | Predictable patterns across the codebase |
| **Clarity** | Self-documenting code that's easier to understand |
| **Maintainability** | Easier refactoring and debugging |
| **Community Alignment** | Following established Kafka ecosystem patterns |
| **Scalability** | Conventions that work as systems grow |

## Topic-Partition Naming

### Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Consistency First** | Use the same format consistently within each context |
| **Community Alignment** | Follow established Kafka ecosystem conventions |
| **Context Awareness** | Different contexts may require different formats |
| **Future-Proof** | Choose formats that scale well as systems grow |

### Single Topic-Partition References

#### Dash Format: `topic-partition`

Use the dash format when referring to a specific topic-partition pair as a unique identifier.

**When to Use:**

- Log file references
- Metric names and identifiers
- Database keys or unique identifiers
- Internal system references
- Directory names
- Cache keys

**Examples:**

```
my-events-0
user-activity-5
order-updates-12
system-metrics-0
```

**Code Examples:**

```ruby
# Metric collection
metrics["#{topic}-#{partition}.lag"] = lag_value

# Log file naming
log_file = "logs/#{topic}-#{partition}.log"

# Cache key generation
cache_key = "offset:#{topic}-#{partition}"
```

#### Bracket Format: `topic-[partition]`

Use the bracket format when the context suggests this is part of a collection, even if currently only one partition.

**When to Use:**

- Consumer assignments (even single partition)
- Partition lists in configuration
- Assignment displays in UI
- Contexts where partitions might be added/removed

**Examples:**

```
my-events-[0]
user-activity-[5]
order-updates-[12]
```

### Multiple Topic-Partition References

#### Multiple Partitions: `topic-[partition,partition,...]`

Use square brackets with comma-separated partition numbers for multiple partitions of the same topic.

**Examples:**

```
my-events-[0,1,2]
user-activity-[0,1,2,3,4,5]
order-updates-[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]
```

**UI Display Examples:**

```
Consumer Group: my-consumer-group
├── my-events-[0,1,2]
├── user-activity-[3,4,5]
└── notifications-[0]
```

#### Range Notation: `topic-[start-end]`

For consecutive partition ranges, you may use range notation for brevity.

**Examples:**

```
my-events-[0-2]        # Equivalent to my-events-[0,1,2]
user-activity-[0-5]    # Equivalent to user-activity-[0,1,2,3,4,5]
large-topic-[0-99]     # For topics with many consecutive partitions
```

**When to Use Range Notation:**

- Consecutive partitions only
- When list would be very long (10+ partitions)
- Configuration files where brevity helps readability

### Cross-Topic References

#### Multiple Topics with Partitions

When showing assignments across multiple topics, use consistent formatting for each topic.

**Examples:**
```
orders-[0,1,2], payments-[0,1], notifications-[0]
events-[0-9], metrics-[0-4], logs-[0]
```

#### Topic Lists Without Partition Details

When partition information isn't relevant, use simple topic names.

**Examples:**
```
Topics: orders, payments, notifications
Subscribed to: events, metrics, logs
```

### Context-Specific Conventions

#### Consumer Group Assignments

Use bracket notation to clearly show which partitions each consumer is handling.

```
Consumer Group: order-processing-group
Consumer 1: orders-[0,2,4], payments-[0]
Consumer 2: orders-[1,3,5], payments-[1]
Consumer 3: notifications-[0]
```

#### Rebalancing Logs

Use bracket notation in rebalancing scenarios to show partition movements.

```
[INFO] Rebalancing started
[INFO] Revoking: orders-[0,2,4], payments-[0]
[INFO] Assigning: orders-[1,3], payments-[1], notifications-[0]
[INFO] Rebalancing completed
```

#### Monitoring and Metrics

Use dash notation for metric names and identifiers.

**Metric Names:**

```
kafka.consumer.lag.orders-0
kafka.consumer.lag.orders-1
kafka.producer.rate.events-5
```

**Monitoring Displays:**

```
Topic-Partition    | Current Offset | Lag
orders-0           | 15,432         | 0
orders-1           | 12,891         | 3
orders-2           | 18,765         | 1
```

#### Error Messages and Logging

Use appropriate format based on context - dash for specific references, brackets for assignments.

**Error Message Examples:**
```ruby
# Specific partition error
logger.error "Failed to process message from orders-3"

# Assignment context error  
logger.error "Cannot assign orders-[0,1,2] to consumer: already assigned"

# Rebalancing context
logger.info "Consumer assigned: orders-[1,3,5], payments-[0]"
```

#### API Responses and Data Structures

Use bracket format for displaying assignments. For structured data, nest partitions within topic hashes following librdkafka conventions.

**JSON API Response:**

```json
{
  "consumer_id": "consumer-123",
  "assigned_partitions": "orders-[0,1,2], payments-[0]",
  "partition_details": {
    "orders": {
      "0": { "offset": 1542, "lag": 0 },
      "1": { "offset": 1123, "lag": 2 },
      "2": { "offset": 1876, "lag": 1 }
    },
    "payments": {
      "0": { "offset": 892, "lag": 0 }
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced Scenarios

#### Dead Letter Queues

Use consistent naming for DLQ topic-partition references.

```
Original: orders-0
DLQ: orders-dlq-0

Original: user-events-[0,1,2]
DLQ: user-events-dlq-[0,1,2]
```

#### Compacted Topics

Apply same conventions regardless of topic configuration.

```
user-profiles-0      # Single partition compacted topic
user-profiles-[0,1,2] # Multi-partition compacted topic
```

#### Schema Registry Integration

Use dash format for schema subject naming that includes partition info.

```
orders-0-value
orders-0-key
user-events-5-value
```

### Implementation Guidelines

| Context | Format | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Single specific reference** | `topic-partition` (dash) | `orders-0` |
| **Single in assignment context** | `topic-[partition]` (brackets) | `orders-[0]` |
| **Multiple partitions** | `topic-[partition,partition,...]` (brackets with commas) | `orders-[0,1,2]` |
| **Ranges** | `topic-[start-end]` (brackets with dash for range) | `orders-[0-9]` |
| **Metrics/IDs** | Always use dash format | `kafka.lag.orders-0` |
| **Assignments/UI** | Always use bracket format | `orders-[0,1,2]` |

**Key Guidelines:**

- Be consistent within each context
- Choose format based on whether it's an identifier or a collection

## Integration and Unit Test Topics

All topics used in integration and unit tests across the Karafka ecosystem should follow a consistent naming pattern to enable easy cleanup and maintenance of test environments.

### Test Topic Prefix Convention

**All test topics must use the `it-` prefix** (short for "integration test").

This naming convention allows for simple cleanup operations using regex matching.

### Standard Test Topic Format

#### Primary Pattern: `it-UUID`

Most test topics should follow the UUID-based naming pattern for uniqueness and isolation:

```ruby
# Good: UUID-based test topics
test_topic = "it-#{SecureRandom.uuid}"
# Example: "it-f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479"

# RSpec example
RSpec.describe SomeConsumer do
  let(:topic_name) { "it-#{SecureRandom.uuid}" }
  
  before do
    create_topic(topic_name)
  end
end
```

**Benefits of UUID-based naming:**

- Guaranteed uniqueness across parallel test runs
- No conflicts between different test suites
- Safe for concurrent execution
- Easy to identify and clean up

#### Secondary Pattern: `it-descriptive-name`

When tests require specific, predictable topic names, use descriptive names with the `it-` prefix:

```ruby
# Acceptable: When specific topic names are needed
test_topic = "it-user-events-compacted"
test_topic = "it-orders-partitioned-by-region"
test_topic = "it-dead-letter-queue-testing"

# Configuration testing example
RSpec.describe TopicConfiguration do
  let(:compacted_topic) { "it-user-profiles-compacted" }
  let(:partitioned_topic) { "it-events-high-throughput" }
end
```

**When to use descriptive names:**

- Testing specific topic configurations (compaction, partitioning strategies)
- Integration tests that verify topic-specific behavior
- Tests that need to reference topics by predictable names
- Cross-component integration tests

### Implementation Examples

**Test Setup Patterns:**

```ruby
# Pattern 1: UUID-based (preferred)
RSpec.describe MessageProcessor do
  let(:input_topic) { "it-#{SecureRandom.uuid}" }
  let(:output_topic) { "it-#{SecureRandom.uuid}" }
  let(:dlq_topic) { "it-#{SecureRandom.uuid}-dlq" }
end

# Pattern 2: Descriptive names when needed
RSpec.describe SchemaEvolution do
  let(:versioned_topic) { "it-schema-evolution-v2" }
  let(:backward_compat_topic) { "it-schema-backward-compat" }
end

# Pattern 3: Mixed approach
RSpec.describe RebalancingBehavior do
  let(:base_uuid) { SecureRandom.uuid }
  let(:consumer_topic_1) { "it-#{base_uuid}-consumer-1" }
  let(:consumer_topic_2) { "it-#{base_uuid}-consumer-2" }
end
```

### Special Cases and Exceptions

**Limited Exceptions**

There are a few existing special cases in the Karafka ecosystem where the `it-` prefix is not used. These exceptions are **legacy patterns** and should not be replicated in new code:

- Some specific integration tests may use different prefixes
- Certain benchmarking or performance tests may have custom naming
- Cross-platform compatibility tests might use specific formats

**Important Guidelines:**

- **Do not introduce new exceptions** without explicit approval
- All new test code should follow the `it-` prefix convention
- When refactoring existing tests, migrate to the standard convention when possible
- Document any unavoidable exceptions with clear justification

### Best Practices Summary

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Always use `it-` prefix** | For all new test topics |
| **Prefer UUID-based naming** | For maximum isolation and uniqueness |
| **Use descriptive names sparingly** | Only when testing requires specific topic characteristics |
| **Clean up regularly** | Using regex-based deletion commands |
| **Integrate cleanup** | Into CI/CD pipelines |
| **Avoid creating new exceptions** | To the naming convention |
| **Document any unavoidable exceptions** | With clear reasoning |
| **Consider environment isolation** | For additional safety in shared development environments |

This convention ensures that test topics can be easily identified, managed, and cleaned up across the entire Karafka ecosystem while maintaining clear separation from production topics.
