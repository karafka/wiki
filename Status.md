!!! info "Status Page - Coming Soon"

    This page is a placeholder for the upcoming Karafka ecosystem status timeline. We're currently setting up the infrastructure to track and display incidents that may impact the Karafka ecosystem.
    
    **What this page will provide:**
    
    - **External Incident Tracking**: Monitor upstream issues from dependencies like Apache Kafka, librdkafka, OpenSSL, Ruby runtime, and compression libraries
    - **Impact Assessment**: Clear categorization of incidents by severity (High/Medium/Low) and affected components
    - **Timeline View**: Chronological incident history with detailed progression from identification to resolution
    - **Workarounds & Solutions**: Immediate remediation steps and references to upstream fixes
    
    **What this is NOT:**
    
    - **Not a bug tracker**: This is not for reporting Karafka-specific bugs or feature requests. Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/issues) for that.
    - **Not individual support**: We only track ecosystem-wide incidents affecting most or all Karafka users, not individual deployment issues.
    - **Not a service uptime page**: This tracks external dependency disruptions, not Karafka's own service availability.
    
    **Incident Scope**: Only widespread issues affecting the broader Karafka ecosystem are reported here. Think major OpenSSL vulnerabilities, Kafka broker regressions, or Ruby runtime changes that impact most users - not configuration problems or environment-specific issues.
    
    **Coming Soon**: We're working on implementing automated monitoring and the timeline interface. Check back soon for the full status tracking experience.
